# OCaml-Language-Interpreter
This repository contains the source code for a string interpreter written in OCaml, designed as a  project in the CS320 class at Boston University on Concepts of Programming Languages. The interpreter is designed to read a string expression and correctly evaluate it while also properly handling errors. The interpreter also supports a variety of functionality; including arithmetic operations,  boolean operations, string concatenation, if then logic structures, and mutually recursive functions. This program is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional features to be added as needed. Furthermore, the interpreter has been designed to be robust and reliable, making it suitable for use in a variety of applications. The source code is well documented and commented, making it easy to understand and modify. This makes the interpreter a great starting point for anyone interested in exploring the implementation of interpreters in OCaml.
